## Understanding Security
**We at DocumentCloud are doing our very best to ensure that any sensitive material you upload remains secure.** Some of the most sensitive documents published by newsrooms have been published through DocumentCloud.

**You should be aware, however, that there are no guarantees.** If you have particularly sensitive documents and, therefore, concerns about security, DocumentCloud might not be the right tool for the job. Get in touch with us and we can suggest some ways to handle your specific situation.

Note:
* All documents uploaded to DocumentCloud are passed through OpenCalais via its API during processing. This is done as securely as possible, but you may also want to look at OpenCalais’s terms of service if you haven’t already.
* This is the internet. Your documents are only ever as private as your password, and documents shared internally are only as private as the least responsible user in your newsroom. There are countless ways to compromise your account, such as logging in from a publicly accessible workstation and failing to log out or accessing DocumentCloud over a public wireless connection. 


## Understanding Privacy
By default, documents uploaded to DocumentCloud are private. You and you alone will be able to see them. This ensures that you will be able to work with the documents while you are reporting your story without fear that they will be viewable by the general public.

* **DocumentCloud does have a [privacy policy](https://www.documentcloud.org/privacy).**


## DocumentCloud’s Privacy Settings
When you upload a document, you can decide whether or not you're ready to make it public. **By default, no one but you will be able to see documents you've uploaded to DocumentCloud.** When you're ready to share your documents, you can make them public—[here's how](publishing_embedding.html#to-change-a-documents-access-level).

Use the **"Private to my newsroom"** option to give your colleagues access without making the document public. You can also share individual projects with other DocumentCloud users, whether or not they're in your newsroom, using our [collaboration tools](collaboration.html).
## Who Can Read Notes?

**Your "private" notes will always be private.**

**Public notes, on the other hand, are as public as the document.**

If access to the document is limited to your newsroom, your "public" notes will be able to be read and edited by anyone in your newsroom. When you make a document public, your public notes become visible to other DocumentCloud users along with it.
