## Sharing Documents with Your Newsroom
When you upload a document, you can decide whether or not you're ready to make it public. By default, no one but you will be able to see documents you've uploaded to DocumentCloud. 

**DocumentCloud features three ways to share and collaborate on documents.**

* You can share a documents with **all the DocumentCloud users in your newsroom** by changing its access level. 
* You can share one or more documents with **specific collaborators who have existing DocumentCloud accounts** (whether or not they are in your newsroom) by creating a project and adding those users to that project.
* You can share documents with an **outside reviewer**, whether or not they have a DocumentCloud account. 


## DocumentCloud Access Levels
<p class="green">Public Access</p>
The document is published. Anyone, even those without DocumentCloud accounts, may access the document. Even if you don’t embed it, it will be indexed by search engines and findable through our API/public search.
<p class="blue">Private Access</p>
The default document access setting. Only the user who originally uploaded the document has access to it. It is not available through our public API or search.
<p class="red">Private to DocumentCloud</p>
All DocumentCloud users in your organization may see the document. Additionally, everyone in your organization will have full privileges on the document. They may add or delete annotations, redact portions of it, move pages, etc. If you want to share your document with a limited number of users, it is better to create a project and [add collaborators individually](#adding-collaborators-to-a-project).

#### To change the access level of your documents:

1. Right-click the document icon.
2. Select **“Set Access Level”**.

## Sharing Documents with Reviewers
**You can share documents for review with individuals who do not have DocumentCloud accounts.** This can be used to crowdsource document annotations from field experts, or for having a non-journalist read over your documents before they are published.

#### To share a document with a reviewer:

1. **Select the document you would like to share.** A blue line should appear around the document icon.
2. Select **“Analyze”**.
3. Select **“Share this Document”**.

5. You will be prompted to include an optional short message.

6. Click **“send”**. DocumentCloud will email a link to your document and reviewing instructions to that person’s email.

## Adding collaborators to a project
**Adding a collaborator to a project gives them the ability to view and edit all of the documents in that project and all the public notes on those documents.** Your private notes will still be private. Once you add a collaborator to a project, the project will appear in their account sidebar for easy access.

#### To add a collaborator to a project:

1. **Hover** over a project.
2. Select the **pencil icon** beside the project name.
3. Click **“Add a collaborator to this project”**.

4. Input the email address of the person you're adding as a collaborator. Click **"Add"**.
5. The project will appear in the **account sidebar** of your collaborator; they may access it from there.

<p class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> Collaborators must have a DocumentCloud account. If you try and add someone as a collaborator with an email address that is not associated with an already-existing DocumentCloud account, you will receive an error.</p>
